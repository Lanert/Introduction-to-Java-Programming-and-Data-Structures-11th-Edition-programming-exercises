**10.1 (The Time class) Design a class named Time. The class contains:**  
● The data fields hour, minute, and second that represent a time.  
● A no-arg constructor that creates a Time object for the current time. (The values of the data fields will represent the current time.)  
● A constructor that constructs a Time object with a specified elapsed time since midnight, January 1, 1970, in milliseconds. (The values of the data fields will represent this time)  
● A constructor that constructs a Time object with the specified hour, minute,and second.  
● Three getter methods for the data fields hour, minute, and second,respectively.  
● A method named setTime(long elapseTime) that sets a new time for the object using the elapsed time. For example, if the elapsed time is 555550000 milliseconds, the hour is 10, the minute is 19, and the second is 10.  
Draw the UML diagram for the class then implement the class. Write a test program that creates three Time objects (using new Time(), new Time(555550000), and new Time(5, 23, 55)) and displays their hour, minute, and second in the format hour:minute:second.  
(Hint: The first two constructors will extract the hour, minute, and second from the elapsed time. For the no-arg constructor, the current time can be obtained using System.currentTimeMillis(), as shown in Listing 2.7,Show CurrentTime.java. Assume the time is in GMT.)

**10.2 (The BMI class) Add the following new constructor in the BMI class:**  
/** Construct a BMI with the specified name, age, weight,feet, and inches**/  
public BMI(String name, int age, double weight, double feet,double inches)

**10.3(The MyInteger class) Design a class named MyInteger. The class contains:**  
● An int data field named value that stores the int value represented by this object.  
● A constructor that creates a MyInteger object for the specified int value.  
● A getter method that returns the int value.  
● The methods isEven(), isOdd(), and isPrime() that return true if the value in this object is even, odd, or prime, respectively.  
● The static methods isEven(int), isOdd(int), and isPrime(int) that return true if the specified value is even, odd, or prime, respectively.  
● The static methods isEven(MyInteger), isOdd(MyInteger), and isPrime(MyInteger) that return true if the specified value is even, odd, or prime, respectively.  
● The methods equals(int) and equals(MyInteger) that return true if the value in this object is equal to the specified value.  
● A static method parseInt(char[]) that converts an array of numeric characters to an int value.  
● A static method parseInt(String) that converts a string into an int value.  
Draw the UML diagram for the class then implement the class. Write a client program that tests all methods in the class.

**10.4(The MyPoint class) Design a class named MyPoint to represent a point with x- and y-coordinates. The class contains:**  
● The data fields x and y that represent the coordinates with getter methods.  
● A no-arg constructor that creates a point (0, 0).  
● A constructor that constructs a point with specified coordinates.  
● A method named distance that returns the distance from this point to a specified point of the MyPoint type.  
● A method named distance that returns the distance from this point to another point with specified x- and y-coordinates.  
● A static method named distance that returns the distance from two MyPoint objects.  
Draw the UML diagram for the class then implement the class. Write a test program that creates the two points (0, 0) and (10, 30.5) and displays the distance between them.

**10.5(Display the prime factors) Write a program that prompts the user to enter a positive integer and displays all its smallest factors in decreasing order.For example, if the integer is 120, the smallest factors are displayed as 5, 3, 2, 2, 2. Use the StackOfIntegers class to store the factors (e.g., 2, 2, 2, 3, 5) and retrieve and display them in reverse order.**

**10.6 (Display the prime numbers) Write a program that displays all the prime numbers less than 120 in decreasing order. Use the StackOfIntegers class to store the prime numbers (e.g., 2, 3, 5, . . . ) and retrieve and display them in reverse order.**
